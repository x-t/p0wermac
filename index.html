     <body> <center><p>PowerPC Mac's hit the scenes in the early 90's. They were revolutionary, and
     					were just what Apple needed at the time...Unfortunatley their domination came
     					to an end in mid 2006 when Apple announced their switch to intel. The PowerPC
     					proccesor had 3 revisions the G3, G4 and G5. Today they all can be found for next to nothing
     					and are available everywhere. </p></center>
     					 
     		
    		
    		<center><p>This is where this website comes in place...The PowerPC proccesor is considered
    		obsolete and no apps are being made for it. But if you are brave like me and decide you want to use this thing. All you need to know
    		is right here</p></center>
