     <center><p>My name is Andrija or Andrew if you will, i got my first Mac in late 2016
     . It is an iBook G4 with a 1.33 GHz CPU and 768 MB of ram. After countless hours on the internet
     i came across a couple of useful website's which helped me get the most out of the G4, i highly reccomend them and i will link them down below!
     Out of boredom a couple of days ago i decided to create my own website, so i started coding on my 
     iBook using TextWrangler.</p></center>

     <center><p>My headquarters are located in Serbia. I am a student which means
     that this website is made in my free time! Because it is nothing special and i dont have money to buy a domain i am using a mix of
     dropbox,updog and a free domain service.</p></center>
        
     
     
     
    <center></p>I have made plenty of html websites in the past before, but i have never invested this much time in them..They were mostly useless fan pages that were basic and only had one "main" page.
     	I love this idea and this project because it was more than someting basic, and i love the fact that i can always work on this, modify and change it to something better that it was before. I want to thank you, whatever or whoever you are.. Thank you for devoting your time to browse
     	and look at this website..</P></center>
     
     <P> Besides the iBook i own my PC. I have currently had a couple of issues with it but its nothing that a OS reinstall cant handle
     i enjoy usng both even though sometimes they can be a pain in the ass..Anyways you have heared enough blabbering about me for now. Go enjoy the website mate!</p>
